<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>

<p>Installing the latest version of rust via <code>brew</code> worked correctly first time.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-tutorial">Finding a tutorial</h2>

<p>Searched for “getting started with rust”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/getting-started.html">Google for ‘getting started rust’</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/getting-started.html">DuckDuckGo for ‘getting started rust’</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Google found the first edition of the tutorial.
DuckDuckGo found the tutorial landing page, which suggested I used the second edition but anyone on google would’ve been unaware it existed.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">the second edition</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-tutorial">Using the tutorial</h2>

<p>The tutorial suggested using rustup to install, using <code>curl | sh</code>.
I decide it’s probably safe to ignore that advice and use the version from my package manager (<code>rustc 1.21.0</code>).</p>

<p>The first example (hello world) works fine.
The second example (guessing game) doesn’t compile.
The error linked me to issue #27703.</p>

<p>I manage to figure out that rust issues are tracked on github (the error just has an issue number), and find that issue.
It’s clearly related, but tells me nothing I can use to get my code compiling.</p>

<p>A bit of searching turns up <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19671845/how-can-i-generate-a-random-number-within-a-range-in-rust#19674981">a stackoverflow question on the topic</a>;
the top answer is outdated, but a comment tells me
to check a different answer, which tells me to
use <code>extern crate rand;</code> and add dependencies to cargo.toml.</p>

<p>After reading up how to add dependencies to cargo.toml, I update the file and try again.
Cargo spends twenty-four minutes ‘updating registry’ (I want one small dependency and have specified the exact version!). My connection is slow, but it’s not <em>that</em> slow.
Activity monitor confirms it’s downloading at 20kb/s - everything else is fine).
Perhaps it would help if the default registry were installed at the same time as cargo?</p>

<p>Now the guessing game example runs - great!
I test out the example and it works.
In doing so, I (incidentally) notice that backtraces don’t have line numbers (!). Close enough for now - I’ll have another look next week or something.</p>
