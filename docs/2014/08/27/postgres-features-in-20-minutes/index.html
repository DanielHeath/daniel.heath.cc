		<h2 id="about-postgres">About postgres</h2>

<p>Postgres is a relational database which is
widely used by Ruby developers.</p>

<p>For instance, it’s the default database for Heroku (a popular
hosting provider for Ruby apps).</p>

<p>Like most databases, postgres uses standard SQL.
It also offers many features which
are not available in most other databases.</p>

<p>I’m going to provide a high-level overview of features
here without providing much detail.
If you have questions, the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql.html">online documentation for postgres</a> is
comprehensive, useful, and up to date.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-features">Overview of Features</h2>

<h3 id="uuid-columns">UUID columns</h3>

<p>By default, Rails gives you tables with an integer ID.
This ID is always generated when you create a new
record - you can’t specify the value for a new records ID.</p>

<p>Postgres supports using a Universally Unique ID (UUID) instead.</p>

<p>UUIDs look like this: <code>93743318-67f4-4c29-8ba0-5ba4f667c7b2</code>.</p>

<p>This can be a useful alternative because it lets you specify
the ID, but will still generate an ID if you don’t specify one.</p>

<h3 id="text-search">Text Search</h3>

<p>Some apps need fulltext search, but running a separate search engine
is hard. Postgres has a reasonably good quality text-search engine built in.</p>

<p>You’ll need to spend some time perusing the documentation to use this - every
app is different and you’ll need to configure the search to suit your needs.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-data">Spatial data</h3>

<p>One of the most commonly used extensions to postgres is called PostGIS.
This lets you store geographic data (e.g. points or areas on a map).</p>

<p>You can then write queries to find (e.g.) what’s
within 10km of this point, with the closest points first.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>Most web applications using postgres will have one server
dedicated to running postgres, with other servers running
the web application.</p>

<p>As the amount of data you’re dealing with increases,
the database server can become overloaded.</p>

<p>There are three common approaches to avoiding this:</p>

<h4 id="throw-money-at-it">Throw money at it</h4>

<p>The easiest answer is usually “buy more ram/CPU/disk”.</p>

<h4 id="partitioning-via-child-tables">Partitioning via Child Tables</h4>

<p>Partitioning lets you use multiple servers, storing part of your data on each of them.</p>

<p>This technique helps you scale a database which is overloaded
due to too many <code>update</code>, <code>delete</code> &amp; <code>insert</code> commands.</p>

<p>For instance, all records where the <code>name</code> field starts from A through F
will go to one server, G through P to a second, and the remainder to a third.</p>

<p>You can achieve this using a feature called child tables (the documentation has good examples).</p>

<h4 id="replication">Replication</h4>

<p>Replication lets you use multiple servers, storing all of your data on each of them.
Only one of the servers is allowed to handle <code>update</code>, <code>insert</code> or <code>delete</code> queries.</p>

<p>This technique helps you scale a database which is overloaded
due to too many <code>select</code> queries running at once.</p>

<p>It is also good because each server has a full copy of the database,
meaning that if the primary database fails, you can
quickly switch to one of the replica servers.</p>

<p>Most modern databases, including Postgres, have good
support for replication.</p>

<h3 id="arrays-and-hashes-and-json-oh-my-xml-too">Arrays and Hashes and JSON, oh my! (XML too)</h3>

<h4 id="arrays">Arrays</h4>

<p>A column in an SQL table has a type (e.g. string, integer, timestamp).
Postgres also lets you can create a column which stores an array of
strings, or timestamps, or any other type (even arrays of arrays!).</p>

<p>If you’re using Rails with ActiveRecord, these arrays
work like normal Ruby arrays.</p>

<h4 id="hashes-via-hstore">Hashes (via HSTORE)</h4>

<p>Similarly to arrays, you can store hashes like <code>{'foo' =&gt; 'bar', 'k' =&gt; 'v'}</code>
This works like a normal Ruby hash through ActiveRecord, except you can
only use strings for the keys and values.</p>

<h4 id="json">JSON</h4>

<p>Postgres has a JSON type which can store any JSON value.
ActiveRecord makes this work nicely with Ruby (with caveats;
it can’t tell that the JSON has changed when
you modify part of a nested structure).</p>

<p>You can query your JSON data using postgres built-in functions.</p>

<h4 id="xml">XML</h4>

<p>The XML type will stop you from accidentally storing something which
is not valid XML. This is better than just using a string field, as
you can be sure that the data you have stored is valid XML.</p>

<p>You can query your XML data using XPATH selectors.</p>

<h3 id="stored-procedures">Stored procedures</h3>

<p>Postgres lets you create stored procedures (functions written in SQL).</p>

<p>You can write these functions in other languages if you have the right
extensions installed; for instance, the V8 Postgres extension lets you
write stored procedures in Javascript. There is also a Ruby extension.</p>

<p>Writing stored procedures in Javascript is clearly a good idea which
will not upset your teammates.</p>

<h3 id="indexing">Indexing</h3>

<p>Big database tables can be hundreds of gigabytes, and it can take a long
time to scan through all that data to find the record you’re looking for.</p>

<p>An index is a much smaller file which can be scanned quickly and tells
the database where to find the records which match a query.</p>

<p>Practically all databases support some kind of indexing.</p>

<h4 id="partial-indexes">Partial indexes</h4>

<p>Unlike other databases, postgres lets you create an index with a
<code>where</code> condition (e.g. <code>create index (...) where (condition)</code>).</p>

<p>This means that the index file can be even smaller and quicker to use.</p>

<h4 id="expression-indexes">Expression indexes</h4>

<p>Postgres also allows you to create an index on any expression (not just a column).
This means you can do things like <code>create index index_name on table_name ( to_uppercase(description) )</code></p>

<h3 id="ddl-transactions">DDL Transactions</h3>

<p>This feature protects you when running migrations.</p>

<p>In other databases, if a migration fails part-way through, the database
can be left half-way between the old state and the new state. Postgres
stops this from happening - migrations either succeed completely, or
do nothing at all.</p>

<h3 id="constraints--deferred-constraints">Constraints &amp; Deferred constraints</h3>

<p>Many databases support constraints (like validations built into the database).</p>

<p>However, they are often hard to use because they can’t be broken, even temporarily.</p>

<p>Postgres supports <code>deferred</code> constraints, which only apply when you commit a transaction.
This makes constraints far more usable with Rails.</p>

<h3 id="foreign-tables">Foreign Tables</h3>

<p>Foreign tables let you run join queries against tables which are in
a totally different database (e.g. MySql or any JDBC database).</p>

<p>Handy when dealing with really big, organically grown systems.</p>
