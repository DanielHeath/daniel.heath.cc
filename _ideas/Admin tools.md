Most developers are unaware that the tools their colleagues in the admin staff use daily have some huge feature gaps & bugs.

Causes:
 * Admin staff not knowing what is possible
 * Admin staff giving up on filing bugs after work is de-priritised repeatedly

Improvements:
 * Developers rotating through support/finance roles
 * Treat feature requests which could result in in-house efficiency gains very seriously; salaries are usually your biggest costs!
