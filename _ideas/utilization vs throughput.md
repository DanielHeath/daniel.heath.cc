Mary Poppendieck does a great job of explaining how it goes wrong

[11:38]
most product / project managers believe <100% utilization is the most important kind of waste to eliminate

dylanlacey [11:38 AM]
My new motto is "Everything is Terrible All of the Time"

aurynn [11:39 AM]
Jira is terrible all of the time

danielheath [11:39 AM]
Mary argues that a more important kind of waste to eliminate is ‘lost opportunity’  waste (when you can’t react to a new market need because your backlog already has 6 months of stuff in it)

aurynn [11:39 AM]
and things that turn into jira are also terrible all of the time

damncabbage [11:39 AM]
This is where three people in the room reading right now reveal that they work at Atlassian on the JIRA team and we suddenly get quiet.(edited)

danielheath [11:39 AM]
Jira is a tool to support PMs in avoiding waste from under-utilization (and it’s actually quite good at that)

[11:40]
and that’s something that most PMs want

[11:40]
what isn’t widely understood is that it’s the wrong thing to avoid

dylanlacey [11:40 AM]
Nah, I know a couple of Atlassian staff members.  Also, if you can't deal with hearing professional criticism of your product maybe you shouldn't be a professional creator.

[11:41]
No-one's saying it doesn't represent a lot of ​_work_​.

danielheath [11:41 AM]
@dylanlacey: straight-up bagging your work always hurts

[11:41]
not wanting to read it all morning doesn’t mean ‘can’t deal'

dylanlacey [11:42 AM]
Sure, but much of what I'm reading here seems to be actual critique, not just bagging.  With maybe a couple of exceptions.

[11:42]
And/Or critque of the usage of Jira rather then Jira itself.

aurynn [11:42 AM]
I’ve not worked with it! So I’m just bagging.

[11:42]
<- is a jerk sometimes

[11:44]
which is absurd given I wrote a huge thing about contempt culture and how I’m currently reinforcing it

danielheath [11:44 AM]
Anyone interested in why PM-s always want to have a several-month backlog (and why it never seems to work well)?

aurynn [11:45 AM]
I am

danielheath [11:45 AM]
there are two main traditions in accounting

[11:45]
utilization-accounting and throughput-accounting

[11:46]
utilization-accounting is (e.g.) we spent $10million on factory equipment - we need to make sure the production line runs at least 90% of the time so we can make payments on the loan + rent on the factory

[11:47]
throughput accounting is (e.g.) we spent $10million making stuff and it took us 4 months to sell it for $11 million (so we can make 1 million per 4 months) - if we could sell it in 2 months we’d be making twice as much money

[11:48]
long backlogs are popular with people who are experienced with the first tradition

[11:48]
since they want to make sure the machine (developers) are utilized 100% of the time (any less is waste)

[11:49]
people experienced with the second tradition care much more about how long it takes to go from customer request to shipped feature

[11:49]
throughput accounting is everywhere in the shipping, retail and manufacturing industries

Commodity VS Luxury.

danielheath [11:50 AM]
but mostly absent in (e.g.) healthcare

[11:50]
if you can bring your leaders around to thinking of waste in terms of lost opportunities

[11:51]
it becomes easy to persuade them to fix tech debt and have products that delight people

[11:51]
if they think in terms of utilization you will only ever be fighting an uphill battle

[11:54]
the only time utilization accounting works is when you are sure there is a market for the end result (e.g. you are making a pure commodity in a market so large your production won’t make a significant dent in demand)

Commodity VS Luxury.
Today at 11:50 AM

danielheath [12:04 PM]
yes, except that there are degrees of commodity

[12:05]
for instance, iron is a fairly pure commodity

[12:05]
arduino-compatible boards are somewhat commoditized, but you wouldn’t want to over-produce them because theirs no guarantee you can sell all your stock

Hmm. Ok, well that escalated. /shrug

danielheath [12:14 PM]
hmm

[12:14]
so, definition of done

(maybe I’ll turn that rant into a blog post sometime)
