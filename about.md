# About

My name is Daniel Heath. Iâ€™m a software developer (usually web development), currently at realestate.com.au.

My main professional interests are:
 * How existing companies can adapt to compete with tech-savvy startups
 * How different organizational structures impact the way development teams work together.
 * Writing code!
